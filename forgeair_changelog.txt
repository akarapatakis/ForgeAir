ForgeAir v1.0a.1007 Changelog
! ForgeAir v1.0a.1007 is a game-changing version that adds a lot of features that are essential for a radio station and opens a new world of customization

- *New: Experimental support for NDI® and BlackMagic DeckLink video output
- *New: Intro/Outro fields in tracks
- *New: pseudo-Direct3D-based Video Output (customizable resolution, refresh rate, colors etc)!
- *New: Video Output is connected with ffmpeg - you will be able to stream the video output and record programe - ffmpeg needs to be downloaded
- *New: Added MediaInfo as an alternative way to retreive metadata where TagLib fails to (at video files, MediaInfo will be the way to do it)
- *New: Video Overlay creator tool & library in the sdk
- *New: Video Output Configuration (for now you can customize logo, overlay, display adapter and some basic behavioral settings)
- *New: Official BUTT Streaming encoder text passsthru (BUTT executable path must be specified in configuration)
- *New: Skip To Track feature (buggy as hell)
- *New: Ability to remember preferences (through ini for now - later at ui)
- *New: Now Playing overlay is based in WebView2. This opens a world of customizability by simple html/css/js
- Fixed video initialization window drawing at incorrect resolutions
- Fixed MME/DSound mono playback when using VST effects
- Fixed small memory leaks in playback
- New initialization script! (faster startup times)
- Fixed a bug where on audio-only tracks, video would randomly jump in a position that is not the same as audio
- Ability to stretch 4:3 videos to 16:9
- Fixed SampleError error when using DirectSound
- Improved album art scaling (pixalization is gone at high-dpi screens)
- Now Playing metadata are now retreived by the database instead of reading the tags where is not needed
- Fixed next button locking the UI
- JSON file for video overlays
- Video Output Customization (Overlay, logo, clock, behavioral settings)
- Added splashscreen while the initialization script is being executed
- Added option to autoplay in startup at system logon
- Fixed light theme applied to window after migration
- Fixed random database exceptions at startup that was caused due to bad multithread management (blame me)
- Fixed timing issues between video overlay and studio ui (causes video overlay to report no track whereas the studio ui reports normally)
- Added handling when the video duration on some h264 files would be 0 (happens with some "youtube to mp4" tools or when the source file is corrupted at the headers) - fixable with ffmpeg
- Fixed a bug where the import track window would hang the whole program randomly
- Fixed a bug where the video overlay would be displayed in advertisements
- Added a check to skip adding to the queue files that don't exist
- Fixed a bug when auto start is triggered and the play/skip button the program crashes
- Improved the way the video logo would render in the output
- Fixed a bug where videos do not play after audio-only tracks (added specific rule)
- Fixed streams play overlapping each other (was a dumb bug, fixed in one line)
- Fixed noticable slowdowns in crossfade
- Added/forced some audio engine flags that may improve playback quality and resolve minor issues that are not related to ForgeAir
- Fixed a bug where sometimes playback would stop after a track had finished and the auto pilot button has to be pressed again in order to resume (sometimes this could make 2 streams play overlapping each other and the elapsed timer going up when nothing's playing)
- Added a check to ignore queueing as next tracks that are currently playing
- Fixed a bug where when a track hadn't any comment set, its album name wouldn't be retreived
- Changed no album fallback text in track from "-" to "Unknown Album"
- Added support for year tag in track import
- Updated video engine to support the new overlay sdk
- Added overlay display at track intro/outro respectively
- Added support for a plethora of video codecs and extensions (H265/HEVC, VP9, VOB, QuickTime MOV, MPEG-2 etc) - fixes black screen when playing a file of unsupported video codec
- Added handling on missing configuration ini
- Added AC3 audio support
- Fixed a bug where at some cases, when importing a track, its selected type wouldn't be followed and it would auto-select as "Song" instead of the selected type
- Changed fallback track type from "Song" to "Other"
- Fixed a bug where when stop is pressed, the video track would continue playback
- Added a workaround that consists of silent video resync with audio every 15 seconds to avoid any desyncrhonization
- Build flag is set from 'Any CPU' to x64 providing better support and performance (support for 32-bit/x86 CPUs has been dropped - was already semi-broken)
- Fixed a bug where the required calculated crossfade time would be retreived at a wrong place causing incorrect timing
- Fixed a bug where on videos the remaining time in milliseconds would not be zero at the ending causing the playback to be stalled. Fixed it by adding a remaining 500ms threshold
- Added VSync support in the video output for specific use cases


Bugs/Issues:
- files that contain raw PCM audio don't play - bass related issue (dev note: quick re-encode to flac before playback)
- If a track is added during crossfade or its preparation it will either crash the program or have catastrophical effects (dev note: block queue in that period)
- Pre-defined effects are not working 
- Sometimes now playing metadata won't be updated (again)
- Audio clicking/popping again under heavy load (eg 4k video rendering or having a 5400rpm hdd OR RUNNING DEBUG BUILDS LIKE ME)
- When a track contains multiple artists, the seperator is ignored causing the artists to be not separated
- Bad text encoding when sending now playing data with Greek/unicode characters to BUTT
- Video window is not resizable
- UI margined at right - low priority

To-Dos:

- *New: Completely Manual Pilot
- Ability to delete track in tracks list window

- ForgeAir v.1.0b is a version series that include a whole overhaul and rewrite in the project (as v.1.0a was for me to learn how to work with, hence the bad performance and stability) and added support for things that are remotely close to the needs of a commercial station

! Due to code changes and new features and for best support, ForgeAir now REQUIRES Windows 10 1809 or later (dropped Windows 7 sadly)
ForgeAir v1.0b.1001 Changelog
