<h2>ðŸš§ Due to my Panhellenic exams, I am currently unable to develop and
 maintain ForgeAir. </h2>

**ForgeAir** is a w.i.p modern, modular and lightweight radio automation system built
with C# and WPF. Designed for my use case mainly but that does not limit you in
choosing ForgeAir.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Requirements

- x64 CPU and host
- Windows 10 1809 (17763) or better
- .NET 8 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022
- Telegram Bot
- WeatherAPI Account
- MySQL/MariaDB server

### Building

- You need to create an account to [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) in
order to make use of the temperature feature in ForgeAir
- You must provide your own BASS libraries from  
[Un4Seen Developments](https://www.un4seen.com/)
provided you already have a commercial license bought
- For crash reporting, ForgeAir uses a Telegram bot. You must create yourself a
 bot to make use of it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akarapatakis/ForgeAir.git
cd ForgeAir
- Create a .env file and add your WeatherAPI and Telegram bot secrets
WEATHERAPI_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CRASH_REPORTER_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXX
CRASH_REPORTER_TELEGRAM_CHATID=XXXXXXXXXX

Open ForgeAir.sln in Visual Studio and build or use MSBuild 

Copy configuration.ini from ForgeAir.Playout to the output directory 
and create a station by modifying the file with:

[Stations]
0=default_station

create the directory tree Stations\default_station
and create a default_station.ini and add the following template

Remember to modify/fill the values for your needs!
